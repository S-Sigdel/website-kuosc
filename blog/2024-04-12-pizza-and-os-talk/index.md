Ahh, who doesn't love to talk about OS while taking a tasty bite on a pizza? Maybe not all the people on the world, but we had an awesome opportunity to do so. This event began by bringing the orders of delicious Pizzas from "The Pizza House, Banepa" and subsequently having a gathering in the Lotus Fountain at Kathmandu University. Then, we all circled up and gave our introduction, and in-addition, what we expected from that session. Many were there for the pizza; the outcome changed however.

The talk's main objective was to distribute the ideas that we had among the people who participated. And I got to know about the Operating System project that KUOSC had been working on to provide to rural areas, where there hardly is infrastructure of internet. I was truly impressed, and contributed ideas of my own in the talk as well. Then came the fun part: PIZZASSSSSSSSS. We all started to take a slice and had our conversation topic diverged from operating systems to programming languages to web and application buildings. I personally thank Mr. Pranish Kafle for providing me with insight of the significance of Java and Kotlin programming language. Then came the second round of PIZZASSSSSSSSS, we all took our slices and started to continue the conversation, which at-last made sure that no one was there for only the pizzas, but the knowledge as well.
